            <h3>Am I worthy to create art?</h3>
            <p>Before I started street photography I had this crazy idea in my head that I am not creative or worthy enough to create art. Not sure if I am now but I don’t care. I take pictures which someone may describe as art, someone else as snapshots. It’s about what makes you happy.</p>
            <h3>Why I like street</h3>
            <p>Any other type of photography requires a substantial investment, dynamic range is important, filters are a must, full frame is a competitive advantage, you have to travel to create your best work… In street nothing of that matters. Do you have a phone? Do you have a point and shoot? Good… that’s all you need. Yes it’s easier to take street-like pictures in cities, but it’s not impossible in the suburbs, in villages (Koudelka anyone?).
            The “hunting ground” is just outside of your door. Landscapes? You have to travel easily for a few hours, wait, get up early or something similar…
            <br />
            So yeah… street is cheap… street is also personal. Get another photographer to stand next to you and he will capture the scene in a completely different way. Street reflects yourself… Something you find interesting may be dismissed by others. You’ll take different pictures when you are happy and when you are down.
            It’s a challenge. Street photography feels like you are bending social conformities, it feels like you are bending the rules of social behavior although you are not. As Eric Kim said and probably plenty of people before him, street is 90% a mental exercise. Yes, there is a possibility of confrontations but it’s miniscule. From 1500 pictures taken in the last 2 months I got yelled at twice… nothing more, nothing less.
            <br />
            Now something cheesy. I love people. I love to watch them, I love to study them. I love capturing fleeting moments in someone’s life. I love finding beauty in the mundane. I love discovering the braveness of shy looking people and the shyness of confident looking ones. On some days I also love observing reactions of people after their picture gets taken.</p>
            <h3>How to get started</h3>
            <p>It’s hard. I won’t be pretending that it’s easy. At least it was hard for me. The fear of the unknown and the fear of negative reactions is the biggest thing I had to overcome. I still struggle on my down days. On those days I just try to take pictures of anyone, I am less concerned of the subject or significance of the scene… I just try to get started.
            <br />
            <br />
            In general, how do you get into street? My journey wasn’t too long…Tried hip-shots on one of my vacations and I was pleased… but that’s not street, at least not the street people are interested in and you quickly get fed up with the low-angle shots. Composition? None… So please don’t even try this technique. What helped me the most was a workshop lead by Eric Kim. Eric is amazing and explains basic and advanced techniques with ease. Yes, the theory is a cornerstone and cannot be taken lightly, but practice and the community were the most important things. Shooting in pairs and making a connection with your shooting buddy were the most important thing for me at least.
            <br />
            <br />
            The workshop ended and the hardest part was to start shooting on your own. My amazing friend Amit was a great motivator. We met during the workshop, weren’t paired up, but he decided to get in touch to go shooting one day. That pretty much changed my life. You don’t have to have a photography buddy. You don’t have to go on a workshop. Just find a friend who will hang out around you while you take street pictures. Read about the masters, learn the techniques, learn the basics…. Explain them to your friend and do actual street photography during these sessions. The mental support of having someone around you is irreplaceable. You will be able to do street by yourself in no time.</p>
            <h3>Tips & Tricks (The secrets stuff)</h3>
            <p>Everyone tells you to take your camera everywhere with you. I think this is not enough. It is at least not accurate. Yes, carry your camera always with you. Hold it in your shooting hand. Always. Heading out for lunch? Get your camera, switch it on and carry it, ready to take a picture within a few seconds.
            Pre-set your camera to something you can use in almost any situation. I am using the P mode in 99.9% of cases (thanks Eric) and I set the ISO to 1600 during the day and to ~12000+ during the night. You may think “This guy is mad…” but I don’t care…. I just want to have the possibility to take a picture at any condition. TvAv or Tv modes will work as well with the shutter speed at around 1/200 depending on the lens and shooting technique (jank of the camera) so just play with it. The flash gets you interesting results but increases the chances of getting punched maybe…?
            Get a camera which is small, easy to use. Those are the basics…more in the gear section.
            Walk on the outside side of the sidewalk. Shooting towards the buildings gives you usually a cleaner background than shooting into the street where a f*cking white car may appear. In general, watch your background.
            Do you want to isolate your subject? Look for “rays of light”. Imagine a roof over the sidewalk with a wider crack allowing light to reach the sidewalk. Position yourself so the light illuminates your subjects faces or anything you’d like to capture and wait…wait…wait… and take plenty of pictures. Just wait for someone to walk into your “light trap”. Optionally play with the exposure compensation to make the shadow areas completely dark.
            You don’t have to look for such a specific location, just find a clean background and stick around. Let people and great scenes come to you.
            <br />
            <br />
            As you already probably now, look for gestures. Look for hands. Is someone scratching their head… take a picture. Is someone smoking? Take a picture… After a while you’ll able to differentiate between common gestures (hundreds of people playing with their phones) and less common ones (a kid making a gun gesture and making a “bang” shooting face) and your eyes will get trained to spot those. Also gestures repeat! You didn’t get the first scratching of their head? Stick around… there is a high probability they’ll repeat that gesture. On the other hand think a bit about the historical context. If people completely stop using phones in a few years, your pictures of these activities will be so much more interesting.
            Try to think about juxtaposition (contrast) between subjects. For example try taking pictures of a grandma and their grandson…. Of someone overweight and someone thin… Also try adding openness into the mix. Where are your subjects looking? What are they worrying about? Try not telling a completed story (a dropped ice cream) but try engaging your viewers more (where are the people looking/pointing to). Let’s say we’ve got a clean background which isolates the subjects pretty well and we’ve got juxtaposition and openness. The next thing to add are layers.. Have someone or something in the front, something in the middle (your subject #1) and something in the back (maybe subject #2). The last thing you have to worry about is composition, such as golden ratio, rule of thirds etc. Every rule can be broken, but in order to break them, you have to know them at first.

            <h3>Shooting techniques</h3>
            <p>Pre-focus your camera to 1m. Pre set what you can. Walk…a lot. Take a picture of anything you find interesting. Are you afraid of taking a picture of a particular scene? Take it! Your body is telling you that this might be your shot of the day/week/month or year. Try asking for permission if unsure and focus on what caught your attention. Did you like the earrings, the subject’s hands, eyes or tattoos? Get close… use macro. Try taking pictures of those…subtract from the scene as much as you can. But you can of course add as much as you can before the scene starts looking chaotic. But you need to know when to stop…</p>
            <h3>Gear</h3>
            <p>I am using a Ricoh GR (the first, not the second one). Just google some reviews and you’ll find why this is one of the best street photography cameras out there. I’d strongly recommend a small, cheap, fast, quiet, manual program and non-flashy camera. Also, do yourself a favor and purchase a couple of spare batteries. I use a hand strap, but plenty of people use neck-straps. I find that neck straps draw more attention than a camera held in the palm of my hand so a hand strap it is for me.</p>
            <h3>Editing</h3>
            <p>Think long term. Collect pictures with common themes during a longer period of time. It’s usually impossible to take a set (e.g. 10) pictures of a given topic during a day, week or even a month or year. Be patient. Just collect your pictures and group them by theme or color for example. You should get a usable set with a year, just be patient. What I try to do is not editing pictures after I take them. I am editing pictures at the end of a month. This gives my feelings time to cool down if I’ve taken a picture under pressure or in a specific state of mind. It helps me to be more objective.</p>
